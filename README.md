# Theater CMS
Our local theater's website looks like it hasn't been updated [since 1993](http://reeldealtheater.com). Here are the goals with this project.
 1. Improve the website in areas where it is lacking such as modern design and mobile friendliness.
 2. It is clear from using the website that the process for updating it involves manual editing of HTML files, so there should be some kind of CMS built to support udating data.
 3. Being that its currently is just html files, it loads very quickly, so the goal is to preserve it's performance.
 
If it's not broken, you can see the live development version [here](https://theater-cms.sutherlandon.com).
